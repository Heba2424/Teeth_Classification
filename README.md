## Teath Classification Project
This project focused on developing a machine learning model to classify various teeth
diseases. We utilized a comprehensive dataset and implemented advanced algorithms to
achieve high accuracy in disease detection. The model has now been successfully
deployed, enabling healthcare professionals to enhance diagnosis and treatment plans.
